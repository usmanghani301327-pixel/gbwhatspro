    <p>
        But is GBWhatsApp really worth using? What benefits does it offer? And what should you know before switching?
        This complete human-friendly guide walks you through everything—features, risks, alternatives, and FAQs.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is GBWhatsApp?</h2>
    <p>
        GBWhatsApp is a modified version of the official WhatsApp app. It was created by independent developers to add 
        features that the regular app does not offer. While not available in app stores, it can be downloaded from several websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite its popularity, GBWhatsApp is not an official product, meaning it comes with both exciting advantages 
        and significant drawbacks.
    </p>

    <h2>Why GBWhatsApp Became So Popular</h2>
    <p>
        GBWhatsApp is known for giving users more freedom. For many, it feels like the upgraded WhatsApp they always wanted.
    </p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Customized Home Screen Layout</h3>
